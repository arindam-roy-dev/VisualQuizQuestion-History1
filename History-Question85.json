"aboutAnswer":"The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra.\nIt was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (1628â€“1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.\nThe tomb is the centrepiece of a 17 hectare (42 acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.\nConstruction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2020 would be approximately 70 billion rupees (about U.S. $1 billion).\nThe construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.\nThe Taj Mahal was constructed using materials from all over India and Asia. It is believed over 1,000 elephants were used to transport building materials.\nIt took the efforts of 22,000 labourers, painters, embroidery artists and stonecutters to shape the Taj Mahal.\nThe translucent white marble was brought from Makrana, Rajasthan, the jasper from Punjab, jade and crystal from China.\nThe turquoise was from Tibet and the Lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, while the sapphire came from Sri Lanka and the carnelian from Arabia. In all, twenty-eight types of precious and semi-precious stones were inlaid into the white marble."
