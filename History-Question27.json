"aboutAnswer":"Hadrian\'s Wall, also called the Roman Wall, Picts\' Wall, or Vallum Hadriani in Latin, was a defensive fortification in the Roman province of Britannia, begun in AD 122 in the reign of the emperor Hadrian.\nIt ran from the banks of the River Tyne near the North Sea to the Solway Firth on the Irish Sea, and was the northern limit of the Roman Empire, immediately north of which were the lands of the northern Ancient Britons, including the Picts.\nIt had a stone base and a stone wall. There were milecastles with two turrets in between. There was a fort about every five Roman miles.\nFrom north to south, the wall comprised a ditch, wall, military way and vallum, another ditch with adjoining mounds. It is thought the milecastles were staffed with static garrisons, whereas the forts had fighting garrisons of infantry and cavalry. In addition to the wall\'s defensive military role, its gates may have been customs posts."
