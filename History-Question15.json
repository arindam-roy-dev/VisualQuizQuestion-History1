"aboutAnswer":"The Black Death, also known as the Great Plague or the Plague, or less commonly the Black Plague, was one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, resulting in the deaths of an estimated 75 to 200 million people in Eurasia and peaking in Europe from 1347 to 1351.\nThe bacterium Yersinia pestis, which results in several forms of plague, is believed to have been the cause.\nThe Black Death was the first major European outbreak of plague, and the second plague pandemic.\nThe Black Death is thought to have originated in the dry plains of Central Asia, where it travelled along the Silk Road, reaching Crimea by 1343.\nFrom there, it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that traveled on all merchant ships, spreading throughout the Mediterranean Basin and Europe.\nThe Black Death is estimated to have killed 30% to 60% of Europe\'s population. In total, the plague may have reduced the world population from an estimated 450 million to 350â€“375 million in the 14th century."
