"aboutAnswer":"The American Revolution was a colonial revolt that took place between 1765 and 1783. The American Patriots in the Thirteen Colonies won independence from Great Britain, becoming the United States of America. They defeated the British in the American Revolutionary War (1775â€“1783) in alliance with France.\nEach of the thirteen colonies formed a Provincial Congress that assumed power from the old colonial governments and suppressed Loyalism, and from there they built a Continental Army under the leadership of General George Washington.\nThe Continental Congress determined King George\'s rule to be tyrannical and infringing the colonists\' rights as Englishmen, and they declared the colonies free and independent states on July 2, 1776. Congress debated and revised the wording of the Declaration, finally approving it two days later on July 4."
