"aboutAnswer":"Gaius Julius Caesar (12 July 100 BC â€“ 15 March 44 BC) was a Roman general and statesman.\nA member of the First Triumvirate, Caesar led the Roman armies in the Gallic Wars before defeating Pompey in a civil war and governing the Roman Republic as a dictator from 49 BC until his assassination in 44 BC. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.\nAfter assuming control of government, Caesar began a program of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the Julian calendar. He gave citizenship to many residents of far regions of the Roman Republic. He initiated land reform and support for veterans.\nHe centralized the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed \"dictator for life\". His populist and authoritarian reforms angered the elites, who began to conspire against him.\nOn the Ides of March (15 March), 44 BC, Caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by Brutus and Cassius, who stabbed him to death.\nA new series of civil wars broke out and the constitutional government of the Republic was never fully restored. Caesar\'s great-nephew and adopted heir Octavian, later known as Augustus, rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the last civil war of the Roman Republic. Octavian set about solidifying his power, and the era of the Roman Empire began."
