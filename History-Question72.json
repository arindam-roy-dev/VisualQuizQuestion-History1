"aboutAnswer":"Easter Island is an island and special territory of Chile in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle in Oceania.\nEaster Island is most famous for its nearly 1,000 extant monumental statues, called moai, created by the early Rapa Nui people.\nIn 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park.\nIt is believed that Easter Island\'s Polynesian inhabitants arrived on Easter Island sometime near 1200 AD.\nThey created a thriving and industrious culture, as evidenced by the island\'s numerous enormous stone moai and other artifacts. However, land clearing for cultivation and the introduction of the Polynesian rat led to gradual deforestation.\nBy the time of European arrival in 1722, the island\'s population was estimated to be 2,000–3,000. European diseases, Peruvian slave raiding expeditions in the 1860s, and emigration to other islands, e.g. Tahiti, further depleted the population, reducing it to a low of 111 native inhabitants in 1877.\nChile annexed Easter Island in 1888. In 1966, the Rapa Nui were granted Chilean citizenship. In 2007 the island gained the constitutional status of \"special territory\". Administratively, it belongs to the Valparaíso Region, constituting a single commune of the Province Isla de Pascua. The 2017 Chilean census registered 7,750 people on the island, of whom 3,512 (45%) considered themselves Rapa Nui."
